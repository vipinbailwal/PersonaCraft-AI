## ## About The Project

PersonaCraft is a full-stack web application built with the MERN stack that allows users to create and interact with AI-driven chatbots. The platform's core feature is its dynamic persona generation pipeline, which uses the Google Gemini API to analyze the communication style from a user-uploaded WhatsApp chat log. It then constructs a unique personality blueprint, enabling the AI to mimic that person in a real-time, streaming conversation.

This project was built to explore the intersection of large language models, user data analysis, and modern web development, with a strong focus on security, scalability, and user experience.

## ## Key Features ‚ú®

* **Secure User Authentication:** Users can sign up and log in, with personas and chat histories securely tied to their accounts via JWT authentication.
* **Dynamic AI Persona Generation:** A unique two-stage AI pipeline:
    1.  **AI Moderation:** First, content is analyzed for safety to filter out inappropriate language.
    2.  **AI Summarization:** If safe, the chat log is summarized to capture the persona's unique tone, emoji usage, and communication style.
* **Real-time Streaming Chat:** Responses from the AI are streamed word-by-word using Server-Sent Events (SSE) for a fluid, interactive conversation.
* **Persistent Conversation History:** Chat histories are saved to a MongoDB database, allowing users to continue conversations later.
* **Full CRUD for Personas:** Users can create, read, and delete their personas through an intuitive UI.
* **Responsive & Modern UI:** A sleek, dark-mode interface built with React and Tailwind CSS, featuring loading skeletons and toast notifications for a smooth user experience.
